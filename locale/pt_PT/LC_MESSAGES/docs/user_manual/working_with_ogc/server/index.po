"QGIS Server uses QGIS as back end for the GIS logic and for map rendering. "
"Furthermore, the Qt library is used for graphics and for platform-"
"independent C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS "
"Server uses cartographic rules as a configuration language, both for the "
"server configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules."
