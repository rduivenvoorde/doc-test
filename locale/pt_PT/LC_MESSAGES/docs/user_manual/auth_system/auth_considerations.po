"Once the master password is entered, the API is open to access "
"authentication configs in the authentication database, similar to how "
"Firefox works. However, in the initial implementation, no wall against "
"PyQGIS access has been defined. This may lead to issues where a user "
"downloads/installs a malicious PyQGIS plugin or standalone app that gains "
"access to authentication credentials."
