"The DB Manager Plugin is intended to be the main tool to integrate and "
"manage spatial database formats supported by QGIS (PostGIS, SpatiaLite, "
"GeoPackage, Oracle Spatial, Virtual layers) in one user interface. The "
"|dbManager| :sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides several features. You can drag"
" layers from the QGIS Browser into the DB Manager, and it will import your "
"layer into your spatial database. You can drag and drop tables between "
"spatial databases and they will get imported."

"The :menuselection:`Database` menu allows you to connect to an existing "
"database, to start the SQL window and to exit the DB Manager Plugin. Once "
"you are connected to an existing database, the menus :menuselection:`Schema`"
" (relevant for DBMSs, such as PostGIS / PostgreSQL) and "
":menuselection:`Table` will appear."

"The :menuselection:`Schema` menu includes tools to create and delete (only "
"if empty) schemas and, if topology is available (e.g. with PostGIS "
"topology), to start a :guilabel:`TopoViewer`."

"The :menuselection:`Table` menu allows you to create and edit tables and to "
"delete tables and views. It is also possible to empty tables and to move "
"tables between schemas. You can :guilabel:`Run Vacuum Analyze` for the "
"selected table. *Vacuum* reclaims space and makes it available for reuse, "
"and *analyze* updates statistics that is used to determine the most "
"efficient way to execute a query. :guilabel:`Change Logging...` allows you "
"to add change logging support to a table. Finally, you can :guilabel:`Import"
" Layer/File...` and :guilabel:`Export to File...`."

"The :guilabel:`Providers` window lists all existing databases supported by "

"If connected to a database, the **main** window of the DB Manager offers "
"four tabs. The :guilabel:`Info` tab provides information about the table and"
" its geometry, as well as about existing fields, constraints and indexes. It"
" allows you to create a spatial index on a the selected table. The "
":guilabel:`Table` tab shows the table, and the :guilabel:`Preview` tab "
"renders the geometries as preview. When you open an :guilabel:`SQL Window`, "
"it will be placed in a new tab."

"You can use the DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial "
"database. Queries can be saved and loaded, and there the :guilabel:`SQL "
"Query Builder` will help you formulate your queries. You can even view "
"spatial output by checking :guilabel:`Load as new layer` and specifying "
":guilabel:`Column(s) with unique values` (IDs), :guilabel:`Geometry column` "
"and :guilabel:`Layer name (prefix)`. It is possible to highlight a portion "
"of the SQL to only execute that portion when pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+R` or "
"clicking the :guilabel:`Execute` button."
