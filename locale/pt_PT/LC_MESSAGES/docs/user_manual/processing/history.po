"Every time you execute an algorithm, information about the process is stored"
" in the history manager. Along with the parameters used, the date and time "
"of the execution are also saved."

"Cada vez que executa um algoritmo, a informação do processo é armazenado no "
"gestor histórico. Juntamente com os parâmetros usados, a data e o tempo de "
"execução são também guardados. "

"This way, it is easy to track and control all the work that has been "
"developed using the Processing framework, and to reproduce it."

"The history manager is a set of registry entries grouped according to their "
"date of execution, making it easier to find information about an algorithm "
"executed at any particular moment."

"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for those"
" learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how "
"that same algorithm could be called from the command line."
msgstr ""
"A informação do processo é mantida como uma expressão de linha de comandos, "
"mesmo se o algoritmo seja lançado a partir da barra de ferramentas. Isto "
"permite ser útil para aqueles que querem aprender como se usa a interface da"
" linha de comandos, uma vez que podem chamar o algortimo usando a barra de "
"ferramentas e verificar o gestor histórico para ver como o mesmo algoritmo "
"pode ser chamado a partir da linha de comandos."

"Apart from browsing the entries in the registry, you can also re-execute "
"processes by simply double-clicking on the corresponding entry: the "
"algorithm dialog opens with parameters already filled; you can then change "
"any of them to fit your needs and re-run the algorithm."

"The :guilabel:`History` dialog also provides a convenient way to contribute "
"to the consolidation of the testing infrastructure of QGIS Processing "
"algorithms and scripts. Right-click on a command you previously executed and"
" you can :guilabel:`Create Test...` for the concerned algorithm, following "
"instructions at :source:`python/plugins/processing/tests/README.md`."

"The history dialog only contains the execution calls, but not the "
"information produced by the algorithm when executed. That information is "
"written to the QGIS log (:menuselection:`View --> Panels --> Log Messages "
"Panel`), in a :guilabel:`Processing` tab."

"Third-party algorithms are usually executed by calling their command-line "
"interfaces, which communicate with the user via the console. Although that "
"console is not shown, usually a full dump of it is written to the log each "
"time you run one of those algorithms. To avoid cluttering the log with that "
"information, you can disable it for each provider, looking for the "
"corresponding option in the provider entry of the settings dialog."

"Some algorithms, even if they can produce a result with the given input "
"data, might add comments or additional information to log if they detect "
"potential problems with the data, in order to warn you. Make sure you check "
"those messages in the log if you are having unexpected results."
