"Calculates a grid of specific catchment area which is the contributing area "
"per unit contour length using the multiple flow direction D-infinity "
"approach. D-infinity flow direction is defined as steepest downward slope on"
" planar triangular facets on a block centered grid. The contribution at each"
" grid cell is taken as the grid cell length (or when the optional weight "
"grid input is used, from the weight grid). The contributing area of each "
"grid cell is then taken as its own contribution plus the contribution from "
"upslope neighbors that have some fraction draining to it according to the "
"D-infinity flow model. The flow from each cell either all drains to one "
"neighbor, if the angle falls along a cardinal (0, π/2, π, 3π/2) or ordinal "
"(π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4) direction, or is on an angle falling between the "
"direct angle to two adjacent neighbors. In the latter case the flow is "
"proportioned between these two neighbor cells according to how close the "
"flow direction angle is to the direct angle to those cells. The contour "
"length used here is the grid cell size. The resulting units of the specific "
"catchment area are length units the same as those of the grid cell size."
