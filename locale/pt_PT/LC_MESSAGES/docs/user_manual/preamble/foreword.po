"QGIS is an Open Source Geographic Information System. The project was born "
"in May of 2002 and was established as a project on SourceForge in June of "
"the same year. We've worked hard to make GIS software (which is "
"traditionally expensive proprietary software) a viable prospect for anyone "
"with basic access to a personal computer. QGIS currently runs on most Unix "
"platforms, Windows, and macOS. QGIS is developed using the Qt toolkit "
"(https://www.qt.io) and C++.  This means that QGIS feels snappy and has a "
"pleasing, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)."

"QGIS aims to be a user-friendly GIS, providing common functions and "
"features.  The initial goal of the project was to provide a GIS data viewer."
" QGIS has reached the point in its evolution where it is being used by many "
"for their daily GIS data-viewing needs. QGIS supports a number of raster and"
" vector data formats, with new format support easily added using the plugin "
"architecture."
